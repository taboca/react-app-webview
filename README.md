## App source code for review

This source was placed online for Google Engineering review, as Google Play Policy engineering framework determinedmy React-native app as malicious. 

The source is here for a few reasons: 

* Add transparency to the process, and therefore to indicate the intentions of the code, and how it abides to React Native framework
* Help Google Engineering to take an alternative review process 
* Help the React Community in case of any recomendation from Google Play Policy system. 

## Architecture (1.0-3.0)

* It's based in the basic React-native app sample plus I have pasted the sample of Web view [1](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/js/WebViewExample.js). 

## Main changes

* Even thought I believe that nothing malicious was in the sample of React-native Facebook code [1](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/js/WebViewExample.js), yet I have simplified the web view, just to avoid the names that were in the code, such as the keyword "inject".
